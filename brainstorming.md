# Evaluating Ideas

## 1. Flashcards App

Description: Lets users create, edit, and flip through custom flashcards to study topics. Could include categories, decks, and spaced repetition features.

Category: Education

Mobile:
	•	Uniquely mobile through touch/swipe interactions, voice-to-text for quick card creation, and audio playback for pronunciation help.
	•	Can use push notifications to remind users to review at optimal study times (spaced repetition).

Story:
	•	Offers a fast, easy, and personalized way to study on the go.
	•	Valuable to students, language learners, or test-preppers—your friends or classmates would likely use this while commuting, in line, or before exams.

Market:
	•	Huge market: high school/college students, language learners, professionals prepping for exams (e.g., GRE, MCAT).
	•	Also a great tool for niche groups like trivia fans or ESL learners.

Habit:
	•	Users would likely return daily for short study sessions.
	•	The app could encourage creating and sharing decks, increasing user engagement beyond passive use.

Scope:
	•	V1: Create/edit/delete cards, organize into decks, basic flip feature.
	•	V2: Add spaced repetition, audio integration, and card sharing.
	•	Manageable to build V1 by end of the program.

## 2. Meditation App

Description: Offers short guided meditations and breathing exercises to help users relax, focus, or sleep.

Category: Health & Wellness

Mobile:
	•	Push notifications for daily mindfulness reminders.
	•	Audio-based experience fits mobile use.
	•	Potential for using the microphone for breath sensors or logging.

Story:
	•	Clear value: helps reduce stress, improves focus, and supports mental health.
	•	Highly relevant to students, young professionals, or anyone with a busy schedule.
	•	Friends and peers are likely to respond positively, especially if the app is simple and low-pressure.

Market:
	•	Broad but competitive. A stripped-down version could target a specific niche (e.g., “5-minute meditations for students”).
	•	Mental wellness apps are growing in popularity; a focus on quick meditations gives it a unique edge.

Habit:
	•	Could become part of a user’s morning or bedtime routine.
	•	Encourages repeat use through streaks, favorites, and playlists.

Scope:
	•	V1: Includes 3–5 preloaded meditations, timer, and calming background sounds.
	•	V2: Add personalization, streak tracking, and breathing guides.
	•	Very achievable within a short dev cycle.
    
# Final Idea!
I picked the Meditation App because it’s easy to build but still meaningful. It uses mobile features like audio and push notifications, has a clear value (helping people relax), and fits a wide audience. It’s something people can use daily, and the MVP is simple—just a few guided sessions and reminders.
